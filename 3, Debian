with Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system
anything which needs a kernel'based operating system can use Debian:
, it supports a wide range of processor architectures
, it's suitable for systems with limited resources
, the stable release provides a highly tested system for sensitive use cases

the following instructions show how to prepare an installation media, in a Unix'like operating system
if you don't have access to an installed Unix'like operating system,
  you can use Debian (or any other Linux distro) live image
first make sure that these packages are installed: sed wget2/wget libarchive-tools xorriso udisks2 dosfstools
download the files of this project:
; wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=1 https://hashbang.sh/~damoonsaghian/Comshell/
; cd Comshell
ensure that the downloaded files aren't malicious
insert a USB storage device (at least 700MB), then:
; sh di/0.sh

now just boot to the USB storage; it will ask for:
, a root password, and a user account (provide different passwords for root and for the user)
, confirmation for auto'detected time'zone
, the network configuration (if it's not a simple DHCP wired connection)
, the target device (if there is more than one device), and then installs Debian on it
after reboot, you can login to the installed system

press "alt+space" to open app launcher menu
in app launcher menu press "alt+space" again to open session management menu:
  poweroff, reboot, suspend, exit, lock
press "alt+tab" to switch between the first app (usually Comshell) and the prior app
press "alt+a" to switch between windows of a workspace
press "alt+escape" to close focused window
press "alt+enter" to open a terminal window

"system" is a command line program which can be used to configure:
  timezone, network, bluetooth, installed packages

package management is atomic (using BTRFS snapshots)
this means that we can have reliable automatic updates

to switch between users, disconnect and reconnect your keyboard,
  or first lock the session, and then press "tab"

to run a command as root:
; su command
this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at top,
  and asks for root password
if the entered password is correct it returns back to previous virtual terminal,
  and runs the command as root

note that you can't login as root; actually root account is locked,
  and root password provided during installation, is used only for "su"
also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt
  (and make sure that it's not fake, by disconnecting and reconnecting your keyboard)
this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking the password entry),
  it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)

"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo"

to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session
in addition you must:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the storage device used for booting
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:
  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
