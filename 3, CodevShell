CodevShell is a Wayland shell based on QuickShell, with a simple interface
there will be an application launcher which can be toggled by pressing "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab"
the first item in application launcher is "system", which opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, update, make a new system)
, backup
if the text entered in the system menu, contains a space, it'll be run in a terminal emulator view
terminal view can be closed (thus the running process killed) by pressing "escape",
	or when the command is finished, simply by pressing "space"
but if you just hide the view by pressing "super" or "atl+tab",
	it will go to the notification area on taskbar
press "super+space" or "alt+space" to cycle through notifications
to close focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

you can easily create a backup of the home directory
backups will be done using "BTRFS send", so they will be incremental, and thus fast
the backup device will be encrypted
each time the device is connected, the backup procedure will be run automatically
even in case of bit rot, this procedure repairs it automatically

to run a program as root:
; sudo <command>
using "sudo" (actually an alias for "doas") in Codev shell does not suffer from these flaws:

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo
because:
, when a user enters "sudo" in command line, it will run /usr/bin/sudo without any manipulation
, reaching to terminal in Codev shell can't be manipulated by normal user
	app launcher -> system -> sudo <command>
, Codev shell only allows keyboard input from real keyboard, or from the built'in on'screen keyboard
, there is no way for normal user to replace Codev shell (if it's started using a display manager)
all these imply:
, a malicious program can't steal root password (eg by faking root password entry)
, to run a command as root, physical access is necessary,
	because there is no other way to enter root password for sudo
