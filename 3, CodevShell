CodevShell is a Wayland shell, based on QuickShell

there is an application launcher which can be toggled by pressing "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab"
the first item in application launcher is "system", which opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, update, make a new system)
, backup
to close the focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

press "alt+space" to show the terminal emulator; to close it press "ctrl+tab"
the entered command will be run in a new terminal view, inside a list at the right
when terminal view finishes its job, if there is any output, its be transfered to the history list under the prompt
to navigate between terminal views, use "ctrl+pageup" and "ctrl+pagedown" keys
to navigate in history list, use "up" and "down" arrow keys
	to re'run a command in history, just press enter on it
to close a terminal view (that will also kill any running process) press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

you can easily create a backup on a removable storage device
backups will be done using "BTRFS send", so they will be incremental and fast
the backup device has two partition:
, a bootable UEFI partition that can recover your entire workflow on a new system
, an encrypted partition containing a backup of your home directory
each time the device is connected, the backup procedure will be run automatically
even in case of bit rot for data in home directory, this procedure repairs it automatically

SPM Linux (still a work in progress) provides a user interface based on CodevShell and Codev
in addition we can use Alpine Linux as the underling system to run CodevShell and Codev
to do that we just need to be in a Posix system, and do these:
, on a removable storage device, create a UEFI partition, format it with FAT32
	run these as root:
	; fdisk -l # find the device name, and write it in place of "sdx" in the following commands
	; printf "g\nn\n1\n\n\nt\nuefi\nw\nq\n" | fdisk -w always /dev/sdx
	; mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdx1
, mount the removable media
, download Alpine Linux installation media from: https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/
	and extract its content into the directory where the removable media was mounted
, run: sh alpine/mkovl.sh
	this will create ".cache/localhost.apkovl.tar.gz" file
	copy that into the directory where the removable media was mounted
, boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions
