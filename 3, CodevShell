CodevShell is a Wayland shell, based on QuickShell

there is an application launcher which can be toggled by pressing "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab"
the first item in application launcher is "system", which opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, update, make a new system)
, backup
to close the focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

press "alt+space" to show the terminal emulator; to close it press "ctrl+tab"
the entered command will be run in a new terminal view, inside a list at the right
when terminal view finishes its job, if there is any output, its be transfered to the history list under the prompt
to navigate between terminal views, use "ctrl+pageup" and "ctrl+pagedown" keys
to navigate in history list, use "up" and "down" arrow keys
	to re'run a command in history, just press enter on it
to close a terminal view (that will also kill any running process) press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

you can easily create a backup on a removable storage device
backups will be done using "BTRFS send", so they will be incremental and fast
the backup device has two partition:
, a bootable UEFI partition that can recover your entire workflow on a new system
, an encrypted partition containing a backup of your home directory
each time the device is connected, the backup procedure will be run automatically
even in case of bit rot for data in home directory, this procedure repairs it automatically

SPM Linux (a work in progress) provides a user interface based on CodevShell and Codev
we can also use Alpine Linux as the underling system to run CodevShell and Codev
to do that follow these instructions (the commands must be run as root)
on a removable storage device create a UEFI partition, and format it with FAT32
; fdisk -l # find the device name, and write it in place of "sdx" in the following commands
; printf "g\nn\n1\n\n\nt\nuefi\nw\nq\n" | fdisk -w always /dev/sdx
; mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdx1
; mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt
extract the contents of the Alpine Linux installer image file, to /mnt
also copy the content of this project to /mnt/codev
now boot to the removable device
note that only UEFI systems are supported; they are the only ones supporting secure boot

to run a program as root:
; sudo <command>
using "sudo" in CodevShell does not suffer from these flaws:
https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo
because:
, when a user enters "sudo" in command line, it will run /usr/bin/sudo
, reaching to terminal in CodevShell can't be manipulated by normal user
	app launcher -> system -> sudo <command>
, CodevShell only allows keyboard input from real keyboard, or from the built'in on'screen keyboard
, there is no way for normal user to replace CodevShell
, sudo works only when called from CodevShell
all these imply:
, a malicious program can't steal root password (eg by faking password entry)
, to run a command as root, physical access is necessary, because there is no other way to enter root password
