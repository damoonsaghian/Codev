collaborative development without the need to keep it's whole history (as is done in version control systems)

we will have three BTRFS snapshots in a project's ".data/codev/" directory:
, pristine
, indexed
, remote

files will be synced up/down to/from the the remote from/to ".data/codev/indexed"
there is no directory tree here, instead we have an index file
"project-path/.data/codev/indexed/index"
entries are separated with empty lines
each entry has 3 lines:
, path
, modification time
, hash

create a remote repository:
; codev new

; codev pull
the shown diff will be based on the working directory, pristine and remote
after merging:
; codev push

Codev also automatically backs up all the projects in those directories containing a ".backup-paths" file
to run it manually:
; codev backup

add or remove users that can push
; codev add username1 username2 ...
; codev remove username1 username2 ...

files in ".cache" directory will not be synced
