collaborative development

flaws of version control systems:
, doubles the storage (working directory, local repository)
, needs to keep the whole history if the project, in order to collaborate with others

we will have three directories in a project's ".data/codev/" directory, containing hash'named files:
, indexed: hard'links to the files in the project
, remote: files downloaded from remote
, pristine: the original files which where reflinked (or copied, if the filesystem does not support reflinks)
  into the project directory

for syncing we use an index file, and rename all files to their MD5 hash
entries in the index file are separated with empty lines
each entry has 2 lines:
, MD5 hash
, path

initialize a remote host:
; codev init remote-host user

create a remote repository from the current project directory:
; codev create remote-host

; codev pull
the shown diff will be based on the working directory, pristine and remote
after merging:
; codev push

codev only acts on projects residing in non-removable BTRFS'formated disks
