a GUI library based on WGPU

widgets: containers, image/video (view and edit), text (view and edit)
multi thread GUI:
	container widget asks the children to stop drawing, and after receiving their reply, cleans their area,
	then sends the new areas to them to draw into
slightly dim unfocused panels
use colored lines on top and bottom of scrollable widgets to show the amount of content above and below
