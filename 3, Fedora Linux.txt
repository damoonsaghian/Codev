using Fedora Linux we can easily setup a Linux based operating system


download and extract the Fedora image
find the device you want to put the Fedora installer on (on Linux use "lsblk")
for x86_64 and aarch64:
format with VFAT
label it
move files
create a systemd boot config file
  inst.ks=hd:LABEL=...

; curl https://damoonsaghian/Comshell/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz
; cd Comshell/fedora
ensure that the files aren't malicious
copy files to the installation medium

in the installed system, you can see the list of projects
here you can power off, reboot, logout, suspend, or lock the system,
  from the applications list, just by typing those commands
each project opens in its own workspace
close the project
hide floating windows

to install packages: "fpm add package-names"
to remove packages: "fpm del package-names"
"fpm" uses and BTRFS snapshots to manage packages in such a way that
  changes to "/usr" and "/boot" would be atomic, and does not interfere with the running system
as a result when you install an application, or update the system using "fpm",
  the system must be restarted for it to take effect
removing packages is done live though (otherwise managing "/etc" would be complicated)
all of this means that we can have reliable automatic updates

to connect to a WIFI network:
; nmcli dev wifi
; nmcli --ask dev wifi con <ssid>
to disconnect from a WIFI network:
; nmcli con down id <ssid>

you can set "user1" for automatic login (run as root):
; echo 'agetty_options="--autologin <username> --noclear"' > /etc/conf.d/agetty.autologin
but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login,
  and lock the session when you leave the computer
in addition you have to:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the boot device
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep in mind that
  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
