using Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system
anything which needs a kernel'based operating system can use Debian:
, it supports a wide range of processor architectures
, it's suitable for systems with limited resources
, the stable releases provide a security proven system for servers

during Debian installtion:
, choose BTRFS to format the disk
, uncheck all tasks to install a minimal system

after booting to the installed minimal system, login as root
download the files of this project, then:
; cd Comshell/linux
ensure that the files there aren't malicious, then:
; sh comup.sh
; reboot

after login to the installed system you will see the main window displaying your projects
here you can also run shell commands

to connect to a wireless LAN:
; wlan
to disconnect wireless LAN:
; wlan disconnect

to install packages: "pkexec apm install package-names"
to remove packages: "pkexec apm remove package-names"
"apm" (atomic package manager) uses "apt" and BTRFS snapshots to manage packages in such a way that
  changes on the file'system would be atomic, and does not interfere with the running system
as a result when you add/remove/update packages using "apm",
  the system must be restarted for it to take effect
all of this means that we can have reliable automatic updates

you can set current user for automatic login:
; pkexec autologin enable
but to protect the computer from physical attacks, you have to disable automatic login ("sudo autologin disable"),
  and lock the session when you leave the computer
in addition you must:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the boot device
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep in mind that
  physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
