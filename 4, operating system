using Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system
use Debian Installer to install Debian on a removable storage device
it's recommended to add a desktop environment like Gnome, when you are asked to select additional tasks
the installed system is in fact an intermediate system which can be used to install the actual one
it can also be used as a rescue medium

in the intermediate system, download this project, and run the "install.sh" script:
; apt install gnunet
; gnunet-download -R gnunet://fs/sks/damoonsaghian/Codev
; sh Codev/os/install.sh
; reboot
the script will configure and rewrite the initramfs of the intermediate system,
	to make it portable across differnt hardwares,
	and then installs the actual system

there would be two applications, in the installed system: Codev, and a terminal emulator
press "alt+enter" ("pun+enter" in action mode) to open app launcher menu
in app launcher menu press "alt+enter" again to open session management menu:
	lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff
press and release "alt" ("pun" in action mode) to switch between the primary app (usually Comshell) and the prior app
press "alt+space" ("pun+space" in action mode) to switch between windows of a workspace
press "alt+backspace" ("pun+backspace" in action mode) to close focused window

"system" is a command'line program which can be used to configure:
	timezone, language, connections, and installed packages

implementing atomic upgrade does not worth the effort, because to have real fail'safe systems,
	redundant backup systems are necessary anyway
to fix a broken system (eg due to powerloss during a system upgrade), the rescue medium can be used

to run a command as root:
; sudo command
this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at the top,
	and asks for root password
if the entered password is correct it returns back to previous virtual terminal,
	and runs the command as root

note that you can't login as root; actually root account is locked,
	and root password provided during installation, is only used for "sudo"
also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt
	(and make sure that the login prompt isn't fake, by pressing "F8" key for locking/unlocking)
this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking the password entry),
	it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)
take a look at these:
"https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/"
"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo"

to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session
in addition you must:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the storage device used for booting
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:
	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
