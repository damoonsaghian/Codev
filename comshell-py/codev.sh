# codev only acts on projects residing in non-removable BTRFS'formated disks

# for syncing we use an index file, and rename all files to their MD5 hash
# each line in the index file: hash path

# xattr: hash, hash'time
# if hash'time is younger than mtime, it means that hash is valid
# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getfattr.1.html
# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/setfattr.1.html

# we will have three directories in a project's ".data/codev/" directory, containing hash'named files:
# , indexed: reflinks to the files in the project
# , remote: files downloaded from remote
# , pristine: the original files which where reflinked into the project directory

# diff will be based on the working directory, pristine and remote

# pull requests contain 2 index files: changed and pristine

# branches: multiple index files

# atomic operations in the server: make directories of hardlinks, mv directory

# openssh + opensc/opencryptoki/coolkey/softhsm: smartcard device to protect the private key

# ssh user@host "command"

# webrtc
