command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster, more convenient and more powerful,
	than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)
pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability
but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),
	there is no need for a pointer based user interface

touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible
touch interface can be useful in some special cases, but it's not good as a general interface

detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
	because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands
a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources
also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit which can be put in a pocket
	this makes the headset lighter and safer

for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based (2d) input can be implemented

= the ideal keyboard
".data/keyboard.png"

navigation keys (arrows, page up, page down, home, end, esc), and ctrl/shift/alt based keybindings,
	are available by pressing and holding "mod" key
pressing one "mod" key while holding the other one, is equivalent to Super key

to insert punctuations (in insert mode), press "pun"
	after entering a punctuation charactor, it automatically returns to normal mode
	unless the "pun" key is still pressed, in which case, it will return to normal mode after releasing "pun"
to insert numbers, press and hold "num"

pressing and releasing "Fn", sends "F1" key press and release
holding "Fn" and pressing a number eg 2, sends "F2" key

to insert capital letters, press comma then press the letter
to insert an all capital word, press two commas
	the following letters will be inserted in capitalized form, until space is pressed
this is how it is implemented:
when comma key is press, keyboard enters the cap mode in which:
, pressing a letter key, sends a "backspace" key, and then the capitalized form of that letter,
	and then the cap mode will be canceled
, pressing comma again, sends a "backspace" key, and activates caps mode,
	which remains active until space (or enter or mod) is pressed
, pressing any other keys, acts like normal, and cancels the cap mode
