<h2>2, command based user interface</h2><div>command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster, more convenient and more powerful,</div><div>	than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)</div><div>pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability</div><div>but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),</div><div>	there is no need for a pointer based user interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible</div><div>touch interface can be useful in some special cases, but it's not good as a general interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),</div><div>	because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands</div><div>a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources</div><div>also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit which can be put in a pocket</div><div>	this makes the headset lighter and safer</div><div><p></p></div><div>for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based (2d) input can be implemented</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>the ideal keyboard</b></div><div><img src='keyboard.png' alt='keyboard.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>navigation keys (arrows, page up, page down, home, end, esc), and ctrl/shift/alt based keybindings,</div><div>	are available by pressing and holding "mod" key</div><div>pressing one "mod" key while holding the other one, is equivalent to Super key</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert punctuations (in insert mode), press "pun"</div><div>	after entering a punctuation charactor, it automatically returns to normal mode</div><div>	unless the "pun" key is still pressed, in which case, it will return to normal mode after releasing "pun"</div><div>to insert numbers, press and hold "num"</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert capital letters, press comma then press the letter</div><div>to insert an all capital word, press two commas</div><div>	the following letters will be inserted in capitalized form, until space is pressed</div><div>this is how it is implemented:</div><div>when comma key is press, keyboard enters the cap mode in which:</div><div>, pressing a letter key, sends a "backspace" key, and then the capitalized form of that letter,</div><div>	and then the cap mode will be canceled</div><div>, pressing comma again, sends a "backspace" key, and activates caps mode,</div><div>	which remains active until space (or enter or mod) is pressed</div><div>, pressing any other keys, acts like normal, and cancels the cap mode</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform'>https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform</a></div><div><a href='https://zealot.hu/absolem/'>https://zealot.hu/absolem/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/foostan/crkbd'>https://github.com/foostan/crkbd</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/nglgzz/42'>https://github.com/nglgzz/42</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard'>https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard</a></div><div>Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard</div><div><a href='http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/'>http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/</a></div>
<h2>3, GNUnet</h2><div><a href='https://www.gnunet.org/en/'>https://www.gnunet.org/en/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div><b>collaborative development using GNUnet file sharing</b></div><div>flaws of version control systems:</div><div>, they double the storage (working directory, local repository)</div><div>, their design makes it difficult to modify the history</div><div>	so in practice, the whole history must be kept indefinitely, even if not needed</div><div><p></p></div><div>when we download a project, a pristine copy is kept untouched in ".cache/gnunet/pristine",</div><div>	and ref links will be created in the working directory, and then we can work on our own branch</div><div>after a while when we want to pull and merge changes made in the main branch,</div><div>	first a three'way diff based on the main branch, pristine, and the working directory will be shown,</div><div>	then the user will be asked to accept different parts of the diff</div><div>to send a pull request to the main branch, first publish the pristine and the working directory,</div><div>	then send the two addresses to the main developer</div><div>	the main developer will make a diff based on these two, plus her own working directory</div><div>a pull request can be removed by sending a message to the main developer, and unpublishing the two links</div><div><p></p></div><div>changelog can be used to record credits, and at the same time, track backdoors</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>trustless secure transaction systems</b></div><div>decentralized internet is already elegantly implemented by GNUnet, but no one is talking about it</div><div>compare it with the hype around decentralized transaction systems, aka blockchians or distributed ledgers,</div><div>	which are inefficient and unscalable</div><div><p></p></div><div>in decentralized transaction systems, we have a P2P network where all nodes store the same ledger,</div><div>	which can be extended based on permissionless consesus between nodes</div><div>distributed ledgers are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self'interests</div><div>appropriate incentives that will continue to encourage honest participation in the network,</div><div>	is a key component of the consensus protocol</div><div>anyone can participate in consensus,</div><div>	though oneâ€™s voting power is typically proportional to its possession of network resources,</div><div>	such as computation power, token wealth, storage space, etc</div><div>see "a survey of distributed consensus protocols for blockchain networks"</div><div>	<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf'>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>so in decentralized transaction systems:</div><div>, every full node has a copy of the ledger (an always growing database)</div><div>	typical blockchains with their currently limited number of users, are hundreds of gigabytes</div><div>	now just imagine that expanded on a global scale</div><div>	also note that, full nodes are necessary if you want private and trustless transactions</div><div>	using light nodes means we have to trust miners; how is that better than trusting banks</div><div>, transactions are slow</div><div>, the system is completely isolated from external world</div><div>	we cannot import external money and assets to the system</div><div>	a necessary feature, if we really want to replace current monetary system</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's clear that the motivation behind blockchains is not to replace the current corrupted monetary system,</div><div>	because it's just not capable to do that, by design</div><div>its only purpose is to create a side system for criminal activities</div><div><a href='http://my.pages.de/illegalblockchains'>http://my.pages.de/illegalblockchains</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>an ideal transaction system would be trustless, and avoids having a single point of failure</div><div>this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to completely decentralize everything</div><div>transactions intrinsically need some centralized parts</div><div>trying to decentralize it by force, based on an ideology, leads to hideous creatures like Bitcoin</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need special nodes (let's call them IO nodes):</div><div>, to import assets from external world</div><div>, to prevent double spending, whithout the need for a complicated consensus mechanism,</div><div>	hurting efficiency and scalability</div><div><p></p></div><div>tokens contain two fields:</div><div>, token type: determining if it's money, or any other kind of asset</div><div>, value+hash (for money tokens), or an identifier encoding the physical aspects of an asset</div><div><p></p></div><div>token history file: a file with the token as its name, containing the history of the token</div><div>each line has three parts seperated by space:</div><div>, timestamp</div><div>, a public key made by the owner (at that time),</div><div>, signature made by the private pair of the key in the previous line</div><div>	in the case of the first line, the signature made by the IO node</div><div><p></p></div><div>tokens are produced and signed by IO nodes based on real resources</div><div>to prevent a single point of failure, tokens will be signed by multiple IO nodes</div><div><p></p></div><div>each IO node publishes all the issued tokens</div><div>for each token, a file will be published, with the token as the file name</div><div>	the file contains the signature of the latest owner</div><div>	the signature is made by the owner's public key, not the key in the history file</div><div>so IO nodes can't make fake tokens, or double spend a token, without being detected</div><div>violations made by IO nodes (double spendings, refusing valid transactions), will be reported,</div><div>	to remove them from next release of GNUnet</div><div>IO nodes do not have any power, they are just there to prevent double spending</div><div>you own your tokens signed off by IO nodes and all the previous owners</div><div><p></p></div><div>owners produce a new key for each token and for each IO node</div><div>so each IO node will have a different history file for the same token</div><div>to steal a token, one has to first hijack all IO nodes,</div><div>	and then somehow find all the private keys that the last owner used to sign the token with</div><div>even if we do not use a post quantum cryptography like NTRU,</div><div>	breaking all these keys with a quantum computer, would be very expensive</div><div><p></p></div><div>transaction request:</div><div>, timestamp</div><div>, list of provided tokens (plus a request for changes if needed)</div><div>, list of requested asset tokens, or the value requested in exchange, or a contract</div><div>, address of the receiver</div><div><p></p></div><div>first a transaction request is sent from sender to the receiver and all IO nodes</div><div>then the receiver sends a compatible answer to IO nodes</div><div>IO nodes sign the request and answer, and send it back to the sender and receiver</div><div>sender and receiver sign off their tokens and send them to the IO nodes</div><div>IO nodes send the tokens to their new owners</div><div>if any IO node receives the signed off tokens, but does not send them back to their new owners,</div><div>	they can be reported using the transaction request/answer which has their signature</div><div><p></p></div><div>the more i think, the more i'm convinced that identities capable to have tokens, must be related to real persons</div><div>otherwise, criminals can force people (by kidnapping, violance ...) to send their money/assets to anonymous accounts</div><div>one can always have different identities hidden from others, but identifiable by IO nodes</div><div><p></p></div><div>taxes, i think, are out of the scope of transaction systems</div><div>they must be evaluated according to the kind of job and a lot of other factors (like environmental damage)</div><div>nonetheless, because of IO nodes, some kind of surveillance can be implemented,</div><div>	to prevent criminal activities, without violating privacy of users</div><div><p></p></div><div>voting:</div><div>real persons submit a public key in their companies, and then can use their private keys to sign their votes</div><div>the complete list of votes will be published by the company, so anyone can check her own vote</div><div>and since the total number of voters is known, there is no place for cheating</div>
<h2>4, computers</h2><div>computers must be portable devices with a USBC (USB4 without PCIe) port,</div><div>	which connects to a display and also provides power</div><div>ports on the display: USB dock, ethernet, audio jack, DP and HDMI (to connect to extra displays)</div><div>the display can have speaker, camera, light sensor and auto brightness</div><div>extra ports (on the computer) for compatibility with old devices:</div><div>	HDMI, audio jack, ethernet, USB</div><div><p></p></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one</div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language</div><div><a href='https://www.bottomupcs.com/'>https://www.bottomupcs.com/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>	especially if the boot firmware is also closed source</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse</div><div>it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors</div><div><a

firmware on nearly all systems are closed source</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)</div><div>in addition, there is no easy way to get rid of Intel ME (or AMD PSP),</div><div>	though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:</div><div>	<a href='https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/'>https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>ARM architecture is closed source too, but in most cases, boot firmwares are open source (U-Boot or EDK2)</div><div>ARM TrustZone can host an open source operating system too, apparently:</div><div>	<a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357</a></div><div>GPU with open source driver: Qualcomm/Adreno</div><div><p></p></div><div>open source CPU: RISC-V, Power ISA</div><div><p></p></div><div>one read'only boot firmware, plus a writable one</div><div>, interrupted flashing does not brick the device</div><div>, no need for complex signing mechanism to make sure a device's firmware is not malicious</div><div>	you just have to make sure that the device boots from the read'only flash,</div><div>	and that the writable flash is empty, the first time you boot the device</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid</div>
<h2>5, operating system</h2><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),</div><div>	and it can be useful for some use cases (like IoT devices),</div><div>	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel</div><div>using Debian we can easily setup a Linux based operating system</div><div><p></p></div><div>boot to a Debian live system</div><div>if Debian live is not available for an architecture, as a workaround,</div><div>	install Debian on a removable storage device, and use that as a live system</div><div>then run this in a terminal (note that s390x and mips architectures are not supported):</div><div>; sudo sh os/install.sh</div><div><p></p></div><div>after booting into the installed system, Codev is ready to use</div><div>Codev is the main application, and fills the screen</div><div>	other applications will be opened in floating windows above Codev</div><div>when "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab" is pressed:</div><div>, if there are floating windows, they will be hidden, and we're back to Codev</div><div>, otherwise the main menu will be opened (in a floating window)</div><div>the main menu contains two views:</div><div>, the first view shows the list of installed GUI applications</div><div>, the second view is the system manager:</div><div>	, manage session: lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff</div><div>	, manage connections</div><div>	, set timezone</div><div>	, change passwords</div><div>	, manage installed packages</div><div>in the main menu:</div><div>, enter "space" at the beginning of search entry, to switch between views</div><div>, press any punctuation character, to clear the search entry</div><div>press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape" to close a window</div><div><p></p></div><div>implementing atomic upgrade doesn't worth the effort, because to have a really fail'safe system,</div><div>	redundant backups are necessary anyway</div><div>to fix a broken system (eg due to power outage during a system upgrade), the live system can be used</div><div><p></p></div><div>to run a program as root:</div><div>; sudo command</div><div>this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at the top,</div><div>	and asks for root password</div><div>if the entered password is correct it returns back to previous virtual terminal,</div><div>	and runs the command as root</div><div><p></p></div><div>note that you can't login as root; root account is locked</div><div>this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking the password entry),</div><div>	it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)</div><div>also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt</div><div>	(and make sure that the login prompt isn't fake, by pressing "F8" key for locking/unlocking)</div><div>take a look at these:</div><div><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/'>https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/</a></div><div><a href='https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo'>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session</div><div>in addition you must:</div><div>, somehow prevent tampering with hardware</div><div>, protect boot firmware by a password</div><div>, disable changing the storage device used for booting</div><div>these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:</div><div>	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources</div></body></html>
