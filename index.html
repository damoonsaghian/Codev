<h2>1, Codev</h2><div>Codev is a COllaborative DEVelopment environment with command'based user interface,</div><div>	as an ideal frontend for GNUnet</div><div><p></p></div><div>list of all projects will appear in a floating layer, at the center of the screen, called overview layer</div><div>overview layer:</div><div>, left panel:</div><div>	, roots: user home plus attached devices</div><div>	, project groups: content of roots</div><div>, main view:</div><div>	projects: content of project groups</div><div><p></p></div><div><img src='codev.png' alt='codev.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>in a project view, the list of files of a project will be displayed in the left side'bar</div><div>opened files will be slightly highlighted</div><div>files and directories with names starting with a dot, will be hidden</div><div>".cache" directory inside a project is for files we don't want to share or backup</div><div><p></p></div><div>each opened file will have a side'bar at right showing its sections</div><div>there we can create new view corresponding to a section</div><div>sections with views will be slightly highlighted</div><div><p></p></div><div>text files will be opened in a text editor</div><div>directories containing media files, will be opened in a gallery view</div><div>files and directories inside a gallery, will be opened in a floating layer</div><div><p></p></div><div>non'local projects, web pages, PDF documents, etc, accessed from links inside the main project,</div><div>	will be opened in a floating layer</div><div>web pages: move caret between visual elements (ignoring structural elements)</div><div><p></p></div><div>actions:</div><div>, next/previous word, line, paragraph, section (righ/left middle row keys)</div><div>, next/previous file (ask for confirmation)</div><div>, next/previous section view, opened file</div><div>, go to the list of files to open a new view</div><div>, start and end selection, then copy or cut</div><div>, paste</div><div>, undo</div><div><p></p></div><div>, navigation: move, search</div><div>, selection</div><div>, completion</div><div><p></p></div><div>for implementing a prototype of Codev, it seems that the best tool at hand is PyGObject</div><div>Python provides a simple consistent API for almost anything</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>command based user interface</b></div><div>command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster, more convenient and more powerful,</div><div>	than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)</div><div>pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability</div><div>but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),</div><div>	there is no need for a pointer based user interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible</div><div>it can be useful in some special cases, but is not a good choice as a general interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),</div><div>	because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands</div><div>a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources</div><div>also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit which can be put in a pocket</div><div>	this makes the headset lighter and safer</div><div><p></p></div><div>for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based (2d) input can be implemented</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>the ideal keyboard</b></div><div><img src='keyboard.png' alt='keyboard.png'/></div><div><a href='https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform'>https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform</a></div><div><a

href='http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/'>http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>the keyboard has two modes: insert mode and action mode</div><div>in action mode keys are mapped to navigation keys (arrows, page up, page down, home, end, esc),</div><div>	and ctrl/alt based keybindings</div><div>in action mode, "pun" key acts like "alt" key</div><div>in action mode, press "space" to go to insert mode</div><div>when "action" is pressed keyboard sends a special key combination,</div><div>	which can be used by applications, eg to flash the location of the cursor</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert punctuations (in insert mode), press "pun"</div><div>	after entering a punctuation charactor, it automatically returns to normal insert mode</div><div>to insert numbers, press and hold "num"</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert capital letters, press comma then press the letter</div><div>to insert an all capital word, press two commas</div><div>	the following letters will be inserted in capitalized form, until space is pressed</div><div>this is how it is implemented:</div><div>when comma key is press, keyboard enters the cap mode in which:</div><div>, pressing a letter key, sends a "backspace" key, and then the capitalized form of that letter,</div><div>	and then the cap mode will be canceled</div><div>, pressing comma again, sends a "backspace" key, and activates caps mode,</div><div>	which remains active until space (or enter or action) is pressed</div><div>, pressing any other keys, acts like normal, and cancels the cap mode</div><div><p></p></div><div>for compatibility with other applications, we may still need a mouse,</div><div>	plus "ctrl" and "shift" keys which can be put in the middle of the keyboard</div><div>for full compatibility we can add a row of function keys, plus the "delete" key</div>

elegantly implemented by GNUnet, but no one is talking about it</div><div>compare it with the hype around decentralized transaction systems, aka blockchians or distributed ledgers,</div><div>	which are inefficient and unscalable</div><div><p></p></div><div>in decentralized transaction systems, we have a P2P network where all nodes store the same ledger,</div><div>	which can be extended based on permissionless consesus between nodes</div><div>distributed ledgers are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self'interests</div><div>appropriate incentives that will continue to encourage honest participation in the network,</div><div>	is a key component of the consensus protocol</div><div>anyone can participate in consensus,</div><div>	though one’s voting power is typically proportional to its possession of network resources,</div><div>	such as computation power, token wealth, storage space, etc</div><div>see "a survey of distributed consensus protocols for blockchain networks"</div><div>	<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf'>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf</a></div><div>so in decentralized transaction systems:</div><div>, every full node has a copy of the ledger (an always growing database)</div><div>	typical blockchains with their currently limited number of users, are hundreds of gigabytes</div><div>	now just imagine that expanded on a global scale</div><div>	also note that, full nodes are necessary if you want private and trustless transactions</div><div>	using light nodes means we have to trust miners; how is that better than trusting banks</div><div>, transactions are slow</div><div>, the system is completely isolated from external world</div><div>	we cannot import external money and assets to the system</div><div>	a necessary feature, if we really want to replace current monetary system</div><div><p></p></div><div>it's clear that the motivation behind blockchains is not to replace the current corrupted monetary system,</div><div>	because it's just not capable to do that, by design</div><div>its only purpose is to create a side system for criminal activities</div><div><a href='http://my.pages.de/illegalblockchains'>http://my.pages.de/illegalblockchains</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>an ideal transaction system would be trustless, and avoids having a single point of failure</div><div>this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to completely decentralize everything</div><div>transactions intrinsically need some centralized parts</div><div>trying to decentralize it by force, based on an ideology, leads to hideous creatures like Bitcoin</div><div><p></p></div><div>we need special nodes (let's call them IO nodes):</div><div>, to import assets from external world</div><div>, to prevent double spending, whithout the need for a complicated consensus mechanism,</div><div>	hurting efficiency and scalability</div><div><p></p></div><div>tokens contain two fields:</div><div>, token type: determining if it's money, or any other kind of asset</div><div>, value+hash (for money tokens), or an identifier encoding the physical aspects of an asset</div><div><p></p></div><div>token history file: a file with the token as its name, containing the history of the token</div><div>each line has three parts seperated by space:</div><div>, timestamp</div><div>, a public key made by the owner (at that time),</div><div>, signature made by the private pair of the key in the previous line</div><div>	in the case of the first line, the signature made by the IO node</div><div><p></p></div><div>tokens are produced and signed by IO nodes based on real resources</div><div>to prevent a single point of failure, tokens will be signed by multiple IO nodes	</div><div><p></p></div><div>each IO node publishes all the issued tokens</div><div>for each token, a file will be published, with the token as the file name</div><div>	the file contains the signature of the latest owner</div><div>	the signature is made by the owner's public key, not the key in the history file</div><div>so IO nodes can't make fake tokens, or double spend a token, without being detected</div><div>violations made by IO nodes (double spendings, refusing valid transactions), will be reported,</div><div>	to remove them from next release of GNUnet</div><div>IO nodes do not have any power, they are just there to prevent double spending</div><div>you own your tokens signed off by IO nodes and all the previous owners</div><div><p></p></div><div>owners produce a new key for each token and for each IO node</div><div>so each IO node will have a different history file for the same token</div><div>to steal a token, one has to first hijack all IO nodes,</div><div>	and then somehow find all the private keys that the last owner used to sign the token with</div><div>even if we do not use a post quantum cryptography like NTRU,</div><div>	breaking all these keys with a quantum computer, would be very expensive</div><div><p></p></div><div>transaction request:</div><div>, timestamp</div><div>, list of provided tokens (plus a request for changes if needed)</div><div>, list of requested asset tokens, or the value requested in exchange, or a contract</div><div>, address of the receiver</div><div><p></p></div><div>first a transaction request is sent from sender to the receiver and all IO nodes</div><div>then the receiver sends a compatible answer to IO nodes</div><div>IO nodes sign the request and answer, and send it back to the sender and receiver</div><div>sender and receiver sign off their tokens and send them to the IO nodes</div><div>IO nodes send the tokens to their new owners</div><div>if any IO node receives the signed off tokens, but does not send them back to their new owners,</div><div>	they can be reported using the transaction request/answer which has their signature</div><div><p></p></div><div>the more i think, the more i'm convinced that identities capable to have tokens, must be related to real persons</div><div>otherwise, criminals can force people (by kidnapping, violance ...) to send their money/assets to anonymous accounts</div><div>nonetheless, one can always have different identities hidden from others, but identifiable by IO nodes</div><div><p></p></div><div>taxes, i think, are out of the scope of transaction systems</div><div>they must be evaluated according to the kind of job and a lot of other factors (like environmental damage)</div><div>nonetheless, because of IO nodes, some kind of surveillance can be implemented,</div><div>	to prevent criminal activities, without violating privacy of users</div>
<h2>3, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>	especially if the boot firmware is also closed source</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse</div><div>it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors</div><div><a
