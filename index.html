<h2>2, computers</h2><div><b>asynchronous digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,</div><div>  until they stabilize to the valid values</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),</div><div>  must operate only when the inputs have correct values</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal</div><div>  the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>  which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)</div><div>  otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div>  i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>  for a duration equal to the delay of one gate</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computers</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one</div><div><p></p></div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>  from a program written in a structured and human readable language</div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>  especially if the boot firmware is also closed source</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse</div><div>it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,</div><div>  with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors</div><div><a

firmware on nearly all systems are closed source</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)</div><div>regardless there is no easy way to get rid of Intel ME (or AMD PSP),</div><div>  though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:</div><div>  <a

in most cases, boot firmwares are open source (U-Boot or EDK2)</div><div>ARM TrustZone can host an open source operating system too, apparently:</div><div>  <a

mechanism to make sure a device's firmware is not malicious</div><div>  you just have to make sure that the device boots from the read'only flash,</div><div>  and that the writable flash is empty, the first time you boot the device</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),</div><div>  and it can be useful for some use cases (like IoT devices),</div><div>  but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel</div>
