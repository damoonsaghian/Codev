<h2>2, command based user interface</h2><div>command based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster, more convenient and more powerful,</div><div>	than pointer based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)</div><div>pointer based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability</div><div>but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),</div><div>	there is no need for a pointer based user interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible</div><div>touch interface can be useful in some special cases, but it's not good as a general interface</div><div><p></p></div><div>detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),</div><div>	because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands</div><div>a headset with near range microphone can be used, to exclude far away sound sources</div><div>also it is better to put battery and transmitter of the headset in a separate unit which can be put in a pocket</div><div>	this makes the headset lighter and safer</div><div><p></p></div><div>for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based (2d) input can be implemented</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>the ideal keyboard</b></div><div><img src='keyboard.png' alt='keyboard.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>navigation keys (arrows, page up, page down, home, end, esc), and ctrl/shift/alt based keybindings,</div><div>	are available by pressing and holding "mod" key</div><div>pressing one "mod" key while holding the other one, is equivalent to Super key</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert punctuations (in insert mode), press "pun"</div><div>	after entering a punctuation charactor, it automatically returns to normal mode</div><div>	unless the "pun" key is still pressed, in which case, it will return to normal mode after releasing "pun"</div><div>to insert numbers, press and hold "num"</div><div><p></p></div><div>to insert capital letters, press comma then press the letter</div><div>to insert an all capital word, press two commas</div><div>	the following letters will be inserted in capitalized form, until space is pressed</div><div>this is how it is implemented:</div><div>when comma key is press, keyboard enters the cap mode in which:</div><div>, pressing a letter key, sends a "backspace" key, and then the capitalized form of that letter,</div><div>	and then the cap mode will be canceled</div><div>, pressing comma again, sends a "backspace" key, and activates caps mode,</div><div>	which remains active until space (or enter or mod) is pressed</div><div>, pressing any other keys, acts like normal, and cancels the cap mode</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform'>https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform</a></div><div><a href='https://zealot.hu/absolem/'>https://zealot.hu/absolem/</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/foostan/crkbd'>https://github.com/foostan/crkbd</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/nglgzz/42'>https://github.com/nglgzz/42</a></div><div><a href='https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard'>https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard</a></div><div>Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard</div><div><a href='http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/'>http://www.allthingsergo.com/the-best-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboards/</a></div></body></html>
